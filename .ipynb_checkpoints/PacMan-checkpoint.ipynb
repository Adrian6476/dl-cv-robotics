    "# COMP52715 Coursework: Task 1 - 3D PacMan\n",
    "Task 1 is to complete the below skeleton code to play a Pac-Man-esque game in 3D. You are allowed to utilise the deep learning method discussed in the course. It is designed to test multiple components of the module syllabus, including 3D geometry, object detection and image manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the coursework is to step through a 3D pointcloud of the mysterious PhD lab. Several large spheres have been placed within the space, it is your job to move through the pointcloud in an automated fashion, detecting the location of the sphere and moving to the predicted 3D location. If you land close enough to a sphere it will be captured and removed from the pointcloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to design deep neural networks to detect the spheres within an image. You can then use the helper function provided in the PacMan_Helper.py module to obtain the XYZ coordinates of the pixel you predict to be a sphere.\n"
